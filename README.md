# Treasure Hunter

## Goal

I've always thought that procedural generation was a very cool and interesting part of game creation. So for this project I decided to tackle implementing a procedurally generated map.
In this case it is an island! Each time you play the map will be different and the goal is find the treasure chest that spawns randomly around the map. The treasure chest is supposed to spawn on
the tiles that make up the island but sometimes will spawn in the ocean which the player is unable to reach... in this case just restart the game.
